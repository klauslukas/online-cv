    summary: |
      First experiences in leading and motivating people I gained in my free-time activities. During my high school studies there were summer camps. Except children I had to organize also camp stuff. During my university studies I had a chance to lead teams of people organizing 4 city games. Each of them took 10 days and almost 150 people got involved. Next few years I was working as IT specialist in ČSOB, but in 2018 I decided to come back to my favourite activity - leading people - as Project manager in ČSOB.

        During my worklife in ČSOB I accepted and succeded in 4 challenges. First of them began during my university studies. I became IT Tester of main ČSOB branch application. Second challenge insisted of analysing changes in the same application. I spent 2 years in IT analyst role. After this challenge my growing up continued. I became IT application engeneer of the main ČSOB branch application. In few months I took responsibility for the whole application and also became it's release coordinator. In the summer of 2018 I decided to come back to organising people. I have started to learn how to be professional in this area. During 2 years of acting as Project manager in ČSOB I delivered 3 projects and participated on 5 more. I acted as IT Project manager on project with budget over 31M CZK. The biggest one I delivered by myself had over 12M CZK budget. We managed to save 21% of planned costs.
